# Download Files from Replit Mobile App

Since you're using Replit on Android, here are the best methods:

## Method 1: Mobile App Export
1. **Tap the menu** (three lines â˜°) in Replit app
2. **Look for "Export" or "Share"** option
3. **Select "Export project"** or "Download"
4. **Save to your phone** or share to Google Drive/Dropbox

## Method 2: Connect to GitHub Directly
**This is the easiest way:**

1. **In Replit mobile app:**
   - Go to your project settings
   - Look for "GitHub" or "Version Control"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Push the project directly to GitHub

2. **Then you can:**
   - Access files from GitHub on any device
   - The build will start automatically

## Method 3: Copy Key Files Only
Since mobile copying is harder, just copy these 4 essential files:

**On your computer or another device:**
1. Open your Replit project in a web browser
2. Copy these files to GitHub:
   - `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`
   - `ocr_number_extractor/lib/main.dart` 
   - `ocr_number_extractor/pubspec.yaml`
   - `ocr_number_extractor/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

## Method 4: Share Links
1. **Generate share link** in Replit mobile
2. **Open link** on computer/laptop
3. **Download files** from web version
4. **Upload to GitHub**

## Method 5: Use Browser
1. **Open Replit.com** in your phone's browser (not the app)
2. **Login to your account**
3. **Use desktop download options** from mobile browser

## Best Approach for Mobile:
**Connect Replit directly to GitHub** - this bypasses the download step entirely and pushes your code straight to GitHub where the APK will build automatically.

Look for GitHub integration in your Replit mobile app settings!
