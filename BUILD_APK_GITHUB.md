## Your Setup is Complete! ✅

Everything is properly configured:
- Flutter project structure: ✅ 
- GitHub Actions workflow: ✅
- Dependencies configured: ✅
- Android permissions: ✅

## How to Build APK:

### Method 1: Automatic Build (Recommended)
Your GitHub Actions will automatically build when you push changes:

1. **Go to your repository:** https://github.com/rajan-code11/ImageTextExtractor
2. **Click "Actions" tab** at the top
3. **Look for "Build Android APK" workflow**
4. **If no build is running, trigger one:**
   - Click "Build Android APK" 
   - Click "Run workflow" button
   - Select "main" branch
   - Click "Run workflow"

### Method 2: Manual Trigger
1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Actions tab** → **Build Android APK**
3. **Click "Run workflow"** (green button)
4. **Select branch:** main
5. **Click "Run workflow"**

### Method 3: Push Any Change
Simply push any small change to trigger build:
```bash
# In Replit shell
echo "# Build trigger" >> README.md
git add .
git commit -m "Trigger APK build"
git push
```

## Download Your APK:

1. **Wait 10-15 minutes** for build to complete
2. **Go to Actions tab** in your GitHub repo
3. **Click the latest workflow run** (should be green ✅)
4. **Scroll down to "Artifacts"** section
5. **Download "ocr-number-extractor-apk"**
6. **Extract the ZIP** → Get your APK file

## Alternative: Release Download
If build creates a release:
1. **Go to "Releases"** section in your repo
2. **Download the APK** directly from latest release

## What Your APK Does:
- **Offline OCR** - no internet needed
- **Process ZIP folders** with images
- **Extract 5+ digit numbers** only
- **Crop first image** → apply to all images
- **Export results** in your specified format

## Troubleshooting:
- **Build failed?** Check Actions tab for error details
- **No artifacts?** Build might still be running
- **APK won't install?** Enable "Unknown sources" in Android settings

Your OCR Android app is ready to build!
