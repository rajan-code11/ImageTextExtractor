# How to Download Your OCR Project from Replit

## Method 1: Download Menu (Easiest)

1. **Look for the download icon** in Replit's interface:
   - Check the **Files panel** (left sidebar) - look for download/export button
   - Check the **top menu bar** - look for three dots or hamburger menu
   - Check **right-click** on the main project folder

2. **Common locations for download option:**
   - **Files panel**: Right-click on root folder → "Download"
   - **Main menu**: Click your profile/settings → "Export project"
   - **Kebab menu** (⋮): Usually in top-right corner

## Method 2: Archive File (I created for you)

I've created a compressed file with your entire project:

**File created:** `ocr-android-project.tar.gz`

**To download:**
1. **Find the file** in your Replit file explorer
2. **Right-click** on `ocr-android-project.tar.gz` 
3. **Select "Download"**
4. **Extract** on your computer using any archive tool

## Method 3: Replit Git Integration

If your Replit has Git connected:
1. **Push to GitHub** directly from Replit
2. **Clone** the repository to your computer
3. **Upload** to your new GitHub repository

## Method 4: Individual File Copy

If download doesn't work, copy these 4 essential files:

1. `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`
2. `ocr_number_extractor/lib/main.dart` (400 lines)
3. `ocr_number_extractor/pubspec.yaml`
4. `ocr_number_extractor/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

## What You Get:

Your download contains:
- Complete Flutter Android app (ocr_number_extractor/)

- Project configuration files

## Next Steps:

1. **Extract** the downloaded file
2. **Create GitHub repository**
3. **Upload** all extracted files
4. **Wait** for automatic APK build (10 minutes)
5. **Download APK** from GitHub Actions artifacts
