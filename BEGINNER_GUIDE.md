## What You'll Build
An Android app that takes ZIP folders full of images, extracts numbers with 5+ digits using offline OCR, and saves results in the exact format you need.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Account (5 minutes)

1. **Go to GitHub.com**
2. **Click "Sign up"**

6. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 3: Upload Project Files (10 minutes)

You need to upload these files from this Replit project:

### Method A: Web Upload (Easiest)
1. **In your GitHub repository, click "uploading an existing file"**
2. **Upload these files one by one:**

**Flutter App Folder:**
- Upload entire `ocr_number_extractor/` folder
- This contains all the app code

### Method B: Drag & Drop
1. **Download files** from this Replit to your computer
2. **Drag and drop** into GitHub repository
3. **Commit changes** (green button)

## Step 4: Wait for Automatic Build (10 minutes)

Once files are uploaded:
1. **GitHub Actions starts automatically**
2. **Go to "Actions" tab** in your repository
3. **Watch the build process** (green = success, red = failed)
4. **Build takes 8-12 minutes**

## Step 5: Download Your APK (2 minutes)

When build shows green checkmark:

**Option A: From Actions**
1. **Click "Actions" tab**
2. **Click the completed build**
3. **Scroll to "Artifacts" section**
4. **Download "ocr-number-extractor-apk"**
5. **Extract ZIP** to get APK file

**Option B: From Releases**
1. **Click "Releases"** (right side of repo)
2. **Download APK** from latest release

## Step 6: Install on Android Phone (5 minutes)

1. **Transfer APK** to your Android phone
2. **Enable Unknown Sources:**
   - Settings → Security → Unknown Sources → ON
   - Or Settings → Apps → Install Unknown Apps
3. **Tap APK file** to install
4. **Grant permissions** when asked

## Step 7: Test Your App (5 minutes)

1. **Create test ZIP** with some images containing numbers
2. **Open OCR app**
3. **Select ZIP file**
4. **Wait for processing**
5. **Check results** - should show "imagename numbers"

## What Each File Does

**Code Files:**
- `ocr_number_extractor/lib/main.dart` - Main app logic (341 lines)
- `ocr_number_extractor/pubspec.yaml` - App dependencies
- `ocr_number_extractor/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Permissions

**Build System:**
- `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` - Automatic APK builder

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` - Project info
- Various guides for setup and deployment

## Total Time: ~40 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails?
- Check "Actions" tab for error details
- Usually fixes itself on retry
- Make sure all files uploaded correctly

### APK Won't Install?
- Enable "Install from unknown sources"
- Check phone storage space
- Re-download APK file

### App Crashes?
